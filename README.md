# Maze-Solver
Takes a 2d array maze and finds the solution.

This is a build on from the Grid Reader, which just takes a file and reads it into a 2d array.
This program takes that 2d array, which it could be a maze and finds the solution by doing recursion.

Maze Solver program was one of the first challenging programs I had to write. I never touched recursion before this so this really pushed my skills. This does not only solve the maze, but records the amount of spaces used, which direction the algo went, and the percent correct out of all the mazes entered during the programs life.
